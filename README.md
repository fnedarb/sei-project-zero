"An Interactive Game"

********** USER STORIES **********

The goal of the game is to measure/improve user reaction times and consistency

User clicks "click this button to start" button

Prompt user for their name and display it above the score screen

After 3 seconds, a dot at a randomly generated position appears on the screen

A timer begins as the dot appears. The amount of time it takes the user to click the screen is logged

An average of the user's reaction time and the last recorded time are displayed

Another dot appears at a different position after a random time less than 3 seconds

Once 10 dots are clickes/times logged, the game is over. The user is presented with the option to restart the game, which preserves the user's average and continues to calculate it


Possible Stretch:

Preserving averages, "User profile", randomized shapes and colors for another layer of difficulty

Unsolved Issues: 

synchronous timers created upon "circle generation", scoring
